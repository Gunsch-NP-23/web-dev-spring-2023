# SUNY New Paltz Spring 2023 Web. Dev. Lecture Repo

This repo. is for following along in class and to be used as a code playground to practice what has been lectured in class and practice what will eventually end up being used and applied for on the final project and class assignments. 

This repo is operated by Frank Gunsch. My experience so far has been what I've learned as a student and as a hobbyist in multiple different disciplines including web dev, java, IBM assembler & more. 
I've taken a course in data structures and have made an online MMORPG loot generation tool.

I hope to use the information learned in this course to further my career and/or hobbies. One example would being make more cool projects.
